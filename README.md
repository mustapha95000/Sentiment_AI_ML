# Sentiment_AI_ML
"""
The Social Media Sentiment Tracker is a Python-based sentiment analysis project
implemented in Google collab research workspace, targeting the analysis of posts
on the Reddit platform. The project utilizes the PRAW library for Reddit API
interactions, pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis. After setting up Reddit API credentials, the
script fetches a specified number of posts from a chosen subreddit, storing
them in a DataFrame. The sentiment of each post is then analyzed using TextBlob,
and sentiments are classified as positive, negative, or neutral. The final step
involves visualizing the distribution of sentiments through a bar chart. This
project serves as a comprehensive guide, demonstrating the entire process from
accessing social media data to sentiment analysis and visualization, providing a
practical template for users interested in monitoring and understanding sentiment
trends on platforms like Reddit or instagram.
